=== rapid_fire ===
**Lighter / Matches**
1. **Prepare**: Gather tinder (dry grass/paper) and kindling (small twigs) FIRST.
2. **Setup**: Make a small pile of tinder.
3. **Light**: Shield from wind. Light the tinder.
4. **Grow**: Add kindling slowly. Don't smother it.

=== spark_fire ===
**Ferro Rod (Sparks)**
1. **Tinder**: Must be very fine and dry (cotton wool, scraped birch bark, dry fungus).
2. **Technique**: Hold striker still, pull rod back.
3. **Aim**: Sparks into the center of the tinder.
4. **Blow**: Gently blow on the ember to ignite flame.

=== friction_warning ===
**Friction Fire (Warning)**
Making fire with sticks (bow drill) is **extremel difficult** and consumes massive energy.
Unless you are practiced, focus on insulation (shelter) instead of wasting hours failing at friction fire.

**The Fire Triangle**
1. **Heat** (Spark/Flame).
2. **Fuel** (Wood).
3. **Oxygen** (Airflow).

**Wet Weather Tips:**
- Find dry wood *inside* dead standing trees (split them).
- Birch bark burns when wet (contains oil).
- Build the fire on a platform of bark/stones (not wet ground).
