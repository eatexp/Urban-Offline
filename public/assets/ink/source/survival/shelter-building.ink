2. Drape tarp over cord.
3. Weigh down edges with rocks/logs.

**Debris Hut (Takes 2-4 Hours)**
1. **Ridgepole**: Prop a long sturdy branch against a tree (waist high).
2. **Ribs**: Lean shorter branches against the ridgepole (close together).
3. **Insulation**: Pile leaves, grass, pine needles on top (2 feet thick!).

**Shelter Priorities**
1. **Insulation**: The ground sucks heat faster than air. Put padding under you.
2. **Wind**: Block the wind.
3. **Dry**: Keep rain off.

**Location Safety:**
- Look UP for dead branches ("Widowmakers").
- Don't build in a dry riverbed (flash floods).
- Avoid hilltops (wind/lightning).
